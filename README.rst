**Here is some documentation: https://heloises.github.io/hoki/intro.html**

Citation
^^^^^^^^^
A peer-reviewed journal article about `hoki` will appear in due time but for now you can use the following bibtex entry:

.. code-block:: none

   @Misc{hoki_citation,
     author =   {Heloise Stevance},
     title =    {Hoki},
     howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/HeloiseS/hoki}},
     doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3445659},
     year = {2019}
     } 
     
**Please if you use `hoki` for your science, do include us in your publications!** As you can imagine developing a tool and maintaining it for the community is very time consuming, and unfortunatly citations remain the most important metric.
